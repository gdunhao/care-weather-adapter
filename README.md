## Future improvements

Follows the list of futures improvements to be applied:

  - Create a cache on the provided endpoint.
  - Separate the modules "care-model" and "open-weather-model" to be separate and versioned artifacts.
  - Create a Spring Cloud Config project to store the application properties.
  - Encrypt the API key.
  - Set up circuit breakers on the communication with "Open Weather API".
  - Create a Docker image.

## Observation

 - This project was created to provide data to the project "care-weather-app" (https://github.com/gdunhao/care-weather-app).
